# apollo-server-example-img
Apollo server docker image example

How does it work?

```bash
clone ...
cd path/to/clonned/dir
./build.sh
./run.sh
./stop.sh
```

and see the result on http://localhost:4000/

Write your query or mutation

Query for example:
```
{
  books {
    title
    author
  }
}
```
